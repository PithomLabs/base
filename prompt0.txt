analyze the code at /home/chaschel/Documents/ibm/go/memos-0244 and write it down as ANALYSIS.MD in markdown

I want to extend memos with Jira like ticket management system with the following requirements:

- a form for adding/updating a ticket complete with the essential fields
- use native storage of memos but provision for sqlite mysql and postgres
- no sprint management (just basic ticket management)
- the deliverable is just one form for ticket management and a link in memos sidebar
- just stick with https://github.com/usememos/memos/tree/v0.24.4 ONLY (read from that repo only, not the latest version)
- use the native react elements in this folder
- /home/chaschel/Documents/ibm/go/memos-0244 is a local version of that repo v0.24.4
- the goal of that analysis is to provide a plan for your implementation so make it detailed as much as possible (that will be your blueprint so make the most of it)

write your analysis in markdown

it works. Now I want to use the replace the description field in ticket form with the memos markdown editor such that when I add or edit the ticket, it will save it to ticket table description field but only the URL of the memo (not the content itself)

no need to modify anything in the editor, retain as is, just adapt the description field

so to clarify, after add/update of description in ticket
1. save description content as new memo record
2. save that memo record URL as value of ticket table description field

ask if you need clarification and write down your detailed plan as MEMO_DESC.MD before implementing


Reply:
I've created the implementation plan at 
MEMO_DESC.MD
.

Before I proceed, I have a few questions:

When editing a ticket, should we:
Option A: Create a NEW memo each time (preserving history)
Option B: Update the existing memo (overwrite)
What visibility should the description memo have?
PRIVATE / PROTECTED / PUBLIC
Should we add a "View Full Description" link that opens the memo page?


------
Should we add a "View Full Description" link that opens the memo page? - Yes
Update existing memo when editing (instead of creating new)
Use PUBLIC visibility by default

in tickets form when I clicked Delete action it does not delete the record (fix it but do not delete the associated memo, only the ticket record)
