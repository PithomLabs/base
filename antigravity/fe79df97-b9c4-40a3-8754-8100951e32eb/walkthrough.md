# Walkthrough - Renamed Ticket List Column Header

I have updated the ticket list to rename the column header "Description (Memo URL)" to just "Description" for a cleaner look.

## Changes Made

### Frontend

#### [Tickets.tsx](file:///home/chaschel/Documents/ibm/go/tix-gemini/web/src/pages/Tickets.tsx)

Modified the table header in the ticket list view.

## Verification Results

The change was a straightforward text replacement in the JSX code. The column header now displays as expected.
